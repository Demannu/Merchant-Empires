<div class="header2">The Infested Zyck'lirg</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Every galaxy in the cluster was flipped upside down when the
	Zyck'lirg hordes arrived. Legend has forgotten who opened
	the wormhole to their space, but will never forgive the crime.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Zyck'lirgs have the fastest ships and weapons, and are dangerous
	to both Xollians and Mawlors. Their organic ships are not as
	easy to detect by sector forces either, letting them scout
	deep in hostile space.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Zyck'lirgs require a biological connection with the ships
	they operate, and therefore cannot learn to fly Xollian or
	Mawlor craft.
</div>
<div class="header3">Swarm Technology (Upcoming)</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Zyck'lirgs ships are equipped with Swarm Technology. They can deploy
	combat drones in all surrounding sectors with a single click. This
	even happens automatically if a Zyck'lirg ship is destroyed.
</div>
<div class="header3">Balance Notes</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	A Zyck'lirg player is one who wants an early advantage in fighting. They don't end their
	career nearly as powerful as Mawlor or Xollian, and when past their prime, they are only
	good for support roles. Elderly Zyck'lirgs tend to be quite bitter about losing their edge.
