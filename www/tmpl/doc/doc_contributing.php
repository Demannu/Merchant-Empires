<div class="header2">Contributing</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Outside of <a href="docs.php?page=gold">donating money</a> there are a few things you
	can do. Note that contributions cannot earn any favoritism from [Redacted]Me Staff.
</div>
<div class="header3">What project are you contributing towards?</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	The Merchant Empires game consists of a fully functioning, open source engine for space
	trade and combat, but it does not come with a complete ship, weps or goods list, those
	are provided by the server host. Official games are hosted by [Redacted] Games, LLC using
	custom ship, weps and goods. When contributing, it is important to distinguish which
	project you are contributing towards.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If your contribution is open source, then it should be submitted in the form of a
	pull request to the public
	<a href="https://github.com/Redacted-Games-LLC/Merchant-Empires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If your contribution is towards the commercial hosting variant of Merchant Empires, that is
	you have an idea for a new ship, weapon, or good you can submit this via our
	<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/merchantempires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a> for
	community feedback.
</div>
<div class="header3">Images and Art</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	New artwork can be submitted via pull request. Include the image file and another text
	file containing the commercial license or public domain release. Name it like so:
</div>
<pre>
        replacedimage.png
        replacedimage.png.license
</pre>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you want recognition then add a separate single commit with your own changes to the
	<a href="docs.php?page=credits">Credits</a>. You get one line, but if you want to ref
	the commit count or something without getting spammy it may not be out of question.
</div>
<div class="header3">Suggestions without Contributions</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you are unable to create art or code you can try pitching your idea on the
	<a href="http://reddit.com/r/MerchantEmpires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a> with the [Suggestion] tag to
	see if someone is willing to implement it for you.
