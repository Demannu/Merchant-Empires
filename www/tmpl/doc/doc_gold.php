<div class="header2">Gold Membership</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Players who have donated to the game are granted Gold Membership status for a period
	of time conferring some cosmetic and convenience perks, but nothing which would give
	significant advantage against other players. 
</div>
<div class="header3">Benefits</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Gold Membership benefits are almost always cosmetic. Here is the list:
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	<ul>
		<li>
			You get a <img src="res/gold.png" height="20" /> Gold Membership ribbon next to your name in various places, and your name is bolded.
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	We have written up a brief <a href="docs.php?page=terms">Terms and Conditions</a> page
	which clarifies our position on bug compensation. While we will put more time and effort
	into responding to Gold Members we stand firm that these terms apply to <em>all</em>
	users and/or players.
</div>
<div class="header3">Enabling a Gold Membership</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Gold Memberships are enabled using Keys which may look like the following:	
</div>
<pre>
	REDACTED-GOLD-031-a0b1c2
</pre>
<div class="docs_text">
	When logged into an active player the menu at the top of the window will have the Gold
	option. This brings up the Gold Key page to manage your keys. Use this page to enable
	a Gold membership, store and protect your unused keys, and transfer keys securely to
	other players.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	When the round officially ends a special key will be generated with any remaining gold
	membership time.
</div>
<div class="header3">Support</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	You can contact <a href="mailto:<?php echo GOLD_EMAIL; ?>">Gold Support</a> if you have
	any issues with your membership.
</div>
