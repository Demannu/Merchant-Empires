	like what we have going on you can <a href="docs.php?page=hosting">download

<div class="docs_text">
	This is a game. All games come with a bit of personal commitment, but the idea
	is to have fun. If it stops being fun you only embitter yourself by sticking
	around. Don't forget to take breaks; get up and pace around a bit every so often
	at minimum.

<div class="header3 header_bold">Compensation for Bugs</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	The long and short is we won't give you back your goods, credits, experience,
	alignment, or turns that you lost for whatever reason. I am sorry for the 
	situation but please report the bug and we can try to fix it or tell us about
	the unfair event and we can examine if there is a balance issue.
