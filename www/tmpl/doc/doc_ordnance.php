	Sector Ordnance
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	There are two types of sector ordnance a player will encounter in the game:
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	<ul>
		<li><a href="docs.php?page=mines">Mines</a></li>
		<li><a href="docs.php?page=drones">Drones</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Sector ordnance responds to the movement of players. Drones attack a player upon
	entering the sector while mines attack a player when leaving. Both mines and drones
	do <a href="docs.php?page=damage">general damage</a>.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Players can deploy mines and drones but can only retrieve drones, mine fields need
	to be manually cleared with weapons. Both mines and drones are easily destroyed.
