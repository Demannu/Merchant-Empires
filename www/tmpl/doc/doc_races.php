<div class="docs_text">
	People of the Galactic races have been at war with each other for almost
	a thousand years, possibly even more. The cause is long forgotten, and very
	few treaties remain. The Imperial Government somehow retains control, but
	it's not sure how.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	All planets in the galaxy have long been made habitable and populated by
	Imperially-governed members of one or more of three dominant races:
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	<ul>
		<li><a href="docs.php?page=xollian">The Secretive Xollian</a></li>
		<li><a href="docs.php?page=mawlor">The Mawlor Dominion</a></li>
		<li><a href="docs.php?page=zycklirg">The Infested Zyck'lirg</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Members of opposing races are <strong>at war</strong> with each other.
	Every attempt at formally ending the war seems to fail. The Imperial
	Government continuously, and mysteriously, refuses to discuss this issue.
</div>
<div class="header3 header_bold">Racial Notes</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	There are <a href="docs.php?page=alignment">alignment</a> changes if you
	kill any allied or enemy player.

<div class="docs_text">
	With the exception of Xollians, players pay taxes on their own racial 
	ports when trading. If trading in an enemy port, they also pay the
	enemy tax rate, including Xollians.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Planetary non-combatants are protected but forbidden to 
	participate in the ongoing war. However, it is common for
	foreign-owned trading ports, outside of Imperial Protected
	Space, to price gouge their enemy traders with a smile on
	their faces.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	There were other races that once inhabited the galaxy cluster,
	but had since disappeared. What little is known has been
	convoluted by propaganda. It is believed amongst some conspiracy
	circles that remaining members of those races are truly in
	control of the Imperial Government, but none have been
	identified in public in centuries.
