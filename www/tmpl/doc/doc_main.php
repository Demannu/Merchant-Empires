	Welcome to Merchant Empires
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	This is a space merchant game of war. The galaxy has been at war for a long time, so long that
	our origins have been forgotten. Dozens of habitable planets filled with life, but no fossils,
	only remains. We didn’t come from this place, we infested it. We don’t know when or how, we
	know only war.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	There are three powerful races of intelligent species in the galaxy called Mawlor, Xollian, and
	Zyck'lirg, and they have been fighting each other hundreds of years. The Imperial Government
	does nothing to intervene. Space flight is restricted to military ships only in all three zones.
	Interplanetary trade is non-existent. People are quickly running out of stuff and getting desperate. 
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Now restrictions on trade have been relaxed. Military ships have been authorized to establish
	ports on any planet in the galaxy. Recruitment has skyrocketed. Some see it as a ruse to expand
	the war, others wonder who is pulling the strings. 
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Each of the racial militaries were quick to claim their share of the hundreds of empty but 
	habitable planets remaining in the galaxy. Any enlisted pilot may improve their racial planets,
	establish bases, and even attempt to subvert control over enemy planets. It is not known if the
	war will stop, or if one race will dominate the galaxy.
