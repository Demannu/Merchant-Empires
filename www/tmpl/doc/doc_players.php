<div class="header2">Players</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Players are human-controlled characters (and in some cases
	bot-controlled with human owners). You can interact with them
	during game play.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	In this version of Merchant Empires, you may have multiple
	players but we ask that you only have one active at a time.
	To make it easier to manage your players, up to four can be
	linked to a user account. When you log in, you will see a
	list of your players or be able to create them.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	The <em>user</em> is responsible for their players, something
	to consider if you choose to let others use a player on your
	account.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	New users should probably read the
	<a href="docs.php?page=races">racial descriptions</a> 
	before selecting a player. Do note that early in the game, it
	will be difficult for you to notice the advantages and
	dis-advantages given to each of them, so don't just create
	players wastefully.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	When creating a player, your name is not case-sensitive
	and must be between 2 and 12 characters. You can only
	use letters and numbers.
